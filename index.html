<h1>Issue with current interface:</h1>
<p>a). Whenever you click a number it procedes to cook for that many minutes, however, when you click another number, it doesnt add that many minutes. It doesnt do anthing at all.

    b). There are alot of buttons like, reheat, defrost, etc. that could potentially be useful but remain unused because they are uneeded. For example, why do I need a
    reheat button on a microwave? Isn't the purpose of a microwave to reheat food? Just put the food in for a minute. I think the interface should be very simple with 
    only efficeint buttons to heat up the food. The more buttons the more crowded the interface seems.</p>
