# Issue with current interface:

a). Whenever you click a number it procedes to cook for that many minutes. There's no indication that it will start once you click a button as opposed to heating
for an amount of seconds or clicking a number and then pressing start

b). It is not clear what the beverage setting does. Does it heat up a drink or boil it? 

c). There are alot of buttons like, reheat, defrost, etc. that could potentially be useful but remain unused because they are unneded. For example, why do I need a
reheat button on a microwave? Isn't the purpose of a microwave to reheat food? Just put the food in for a minute. I think the interface should be very simple with 
only buttons to heat up the food. The more buttons the more crowded the interface seems.

# Common Uses:

a). The most common use I have is heating up food by just clicking a number for the amount of minutes I want to cook.

b). Another common use is the "Add 30" seconds number that either starts the microwave for 30 seconds or adds 30 seconds to the current cooke time.

# Uncommon Uses:

a). A more uncommomn use is the "popcorn" button on the interface. I click it whenever I have popcorn but most of the time it only cooks half the bag and leaves the 
rest kernels. This means I have to add more time anyways.

b). I also use the "defrost" button whenever I need to defrost food. Once again, I typically end up needing to run the frozen food through one or two defrost cycles 
before it actually thaws out.
