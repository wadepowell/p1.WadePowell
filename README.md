Issue with current interface:
a). Whenever you click a numebr it procedes to cook for that many minutes. There's no indication that it will start once you click a button as opposed to heating
for an amount of seconds.


a). It is not clear what the beverage setting does. Does it heat up a drink or boil water? 

b). I think the interface should be very simple with only buttons to heat up the food. The more buttons the more crowded the interface seems.

c). There are alot of buttons like, reheat, defrost, etc. that could potentially be useful but remain unused because they are unneded. For example, why do I need a reheat button on a microwave? Isn't the purpose of a microwave to reheat food? Just put the food in for a minute.
